Octopress GUI
=============

This project aim to bring the octopress blogging framework to everybody. Octopress is a command line tool but it's a wonderful blogging plaform and it should'nt be restricted to CLI users. That is why i'm creating a GUI on top of it.

I aim to bring a most beautiful and native look and feel as possible. This is why i'll be using these frameworks :

* HotCocoa (for OSX)
* GTK+ (for linux)
* ? (for Windows)

I don't know yet what would be the best for Windows. Maybe IronRuby or something...

ROADMAP
---

* Create and browse posts
* Edit configurations
* Deploy with rsync
* OSX GUI
